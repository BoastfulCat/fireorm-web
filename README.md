FireORM for Web - is a tiny wrapper on top of web firebase package, based on [fireorm](https://github.com/wovalle/fireorm) codebase that makes life easier when dealing with a Firestore database. FireORM-Web tries to ease the development of apps that rely on Firestore at the database layer by abstracting the access layer providing a familiar repository pattern. It basically helps us not worry about Firestore details and focus on what matters: adding cool new features!

## Installation

1. Install the npm package:

```bash
npm install fireorm-web --save`
```

2. You need to install `reflect-metadata` shim:

```bash
npm install reflect-metadata --save
```

and import it somewhere in the global place of your app (for example in `app.ts`):

```ts
import "reflect-metadata";
```

3. TypeScript configuration

Also, make sure you are using TypeScript version **4.5** or higher,
and you have enabled the following settings in `tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "emitDecoratorMetadata": true,
  "experimentalDecorators": true
}
```

4. [Initialize](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart#initialize) your Firestore application:

```ts
import {initializeApp} from 'firebase/app';
import {getFirestore} from 'firebase/firestore';
import {initialize} from 'fireorm-web';

const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: process.env.API_KEY,
  authDomain: process.env.AUTH_DOMAIN,
  projectId: process.env.PROJECT_ID,
  storageBucket: process.env.STORAGE_BUCKET,
  messagingSenderId: process.env.SENDER_ID,
  appId: process.env.APP_ID,
};

// - or - 
// const firebaseConfig = require('/path_to_json/firestore.creds.json');

const firebaseApp = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
const firebaseFirestore = getFirestore(firebaseApp);

initialize(firebaseFirestore);
```

## Usage

1. Create your Firestore models

```ts
import { Collection } from 'fireorm-web';

@Collection()
class Todo {
  _id: string;
  text: string;
  done: Boolean;
}
```

2. And your domain logic looks like this

```ts
import { getRepository } from 'fireorm-web';

const todoRepository = getRepository(Todo);

const todo = new Todo();
todo.text = "Check FireORM-Web GitHub repository";
todo.done = false;

// Create record
const todoDocument = await todoRepository.create(todo);

// Read record
const mySuperTodoDocument = await todoRepository.findById(todoDocument._id);

// Update record
await todoRepository.update(mySuperTodoDocument);

// Delete record
await todoRepository.delete(mySuperTodoDocument._id);
```

### Firebase Complex Data Types

Firestore has support for [complex data types](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/manage-data/data-types) such as GeoPoint and Reference. Full handling of complex data types is [being handled in this issue in fireorm](https://github.com/wovalle/fireorm/issues/58). Temporarily, fireorm and fireorm-web will export [Class Transformer's @Type](https://github.com/typestack/class-transformer#working-with-nested-objects) decorator. It receives a lamda where you return the type you want to cast to.

### Core Concepts

FireORM-Web is just a library to simplify the way we communicate with web firestore. It does not implement the underlying communication with the database (it resorts to official sdk's for that, such as [firebase](https://www.npmjs.com/package/firebase)).

### Firestore

According to [it's homepage](https://cloud.google.com/firestore), Firestore is a fast, fully managed, serverless, cloud-native NoSQL document database that simplifies storing, syncing, and querying data for your mobile, web, and IoT apps at global scale.

In Firestore, data is stored in _Documents_ which are organized into _Collections_ that may also contain _SubCollections_.

To take full advantage of what fireorm's have to offer, is recommended that you are familiarized with [Firestore Data Model](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/data-model).

### FireORM-Web Models

Models in fireorm-web are just a way to specify the shape that our data (or _Documents_) will have. Models are represented with [JavaScript Classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes)!

For example, let's pretend that we want to store information about Rock Bands:the band name, formation year and array of genres. Our Model would look like this:

```ts
class Band {
  _id: string;
  name: string;
  formationYear: number;
  genres: string[];
}
```

Wait, I only mentioned name, formationYear and genres in my original specification, so why does the model have a string property called `_id`? Because of the way the data is stored in Firestore, **it's required that every model contain a string property called _id**. If you create a model without the `_id` property (or with another data type such as Number or Symbol) fireorm-web won't work correctly.

### FireORM-Web Collections

Great, we have a model, but how can we ‘take’ our model and ‘store’ it the database? In Firestore we store data in _[Documents](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/data-model#documents)_ and they are organized into _[Collections](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/data-model#collections)_. To represent a Collection in our code, we'll use a fairly new JavaScript feature which Typescript lets us use super easy: [Decorators](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/decorators.html).

To declare Collections we can just _decorate_ our model class with fireorm-web `Collection` decorator and each instance of the model would act as a Firestore Document.

```ts
import { Collection } from 'fireorm-web';

@Collection()
class Band {
  _id: string;
  name: string;
  formationYear: number;
  genres: string[];
}
```

See how we're importing the `Collection` decorator from fireorm-web and we're decorating our Band class with it. Internally, fireorm-web will treat each instance of Band as a Firestore Document.

Wait, Firestore Collections must have a name. What will be the name of that collection? By default, fireorm-web will name the collections with the plural form of the Model name in lower case, in this case `bands`. If you want you use your own name, you can pass a string as the first parameter of the Decorator.

```ts
@Collection('RockBands')
```

### FireORM-Web Repositories

One of my goals when developing this library was to create a way to use the Repository Pattern with Firestore as easily as possible. We have our models, we have our collections, but how are we supposed to make CRUD operations? That’s what Repositories are for.

> In general, repositories are classes or components that encapsulate the logic required to access data sources. They centralize common data access functionality, providing better maintainability and decoupling the infrastructure or technology used to access databases from the domain model layer ([source](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/microservices/microservice-ddd-cqrs-patterns/infrastructure-persistence-layer-design)).

Repositories provide the necessary methods to create, retrieve, update and delete documents from our Firestore collections. To create a repository from a collection we can just call `getRepository` method.

```ts
import { Collection, getRepository } from 'fireorm-web';

@Collection()
class Band {
  _id: string;
  name: string;
  formationYear: number;
  genres: string[];
}

const bandRepository = getRepository(Band);
```

The variable `bandRepository` contains all the methods to interact with our `band`. You can retrieve, create, update, delete and do complex queries over our Bands collection!

## Reading Data

This is where fun starts! Once we have initialized fireorm-web in our application we can start using it.

We'll continue working with the Band's collection we defined in Core Concept's section.

### Simple Queries

FireORM-Web Repositories have the method `findById` which you can use to retrieve documents by its id.

Let's imagine we have a Document in our Bands Collection in firestore with an id `red-hot-chilli-peppers`. To retrieve it we only have to use the handy findById method in our repository.

```ts
import { Collection, getRepository } from 'fireorm-web';

@Collection()
class Band {
  _id: string;
  name: string;
  formationYear: number;
  genres: string[];
}

const bandRepository = getRepository(Band);

const band = await bandRepository.findById('red-hot-chilli-peppers');
```

Now the variable band is an instance of our Band model that contains the information about the band.

### Simple Queries with Realtime Updates

If you need to listen for updates document in realtime, you can use the "findByIdAndListen" method of the repository. In the arguments, you can specify callback functions that will be called when a data change detect or error.

```ts
function renderBandIten(band) {
  // ... some render logic
}

// find document and start listen
const unsubscribe = getRepository(Band)
  .findByIdAndListen('red-hot-chilli-peppers', renderBandIten, console.error);

// stop listen
unsubscribe();
```

This approach will be convenient when used in a single page application.

### Complex Queries

Only being able to find documents by id is a bit limiting, that's why fireorm-web repositories provide a lot of helper functions to ease the filtering of data in queries. These are `whereEqualTo`, `whereGreaterThan`, `whereGreaterOrEqualTha`, `whereLessThan`, `whereLessOrEqualThan`, `whereArrayContains`, `whereIn` and `whereArrayContainsAny` methods. We can pipe as many methods as we need to perform complex queries, as long as we don’t forget to call the `find` method at the end.

```ts
// Bands formed from 1990 onwards
await bandRepository
  .whereGreaterOrEqualThan('formationYear', 1990)
  .find();

// Bands whose name is Porcupine Tree
await bandRepository
  .whereEqualTo('name', 'Porcupine Tree')
  .find();

// Bands formed after 1985 and that play Progressive Rock
await bandRepository
  .whereGreaterThan('formationYear', 1985)
  .whereArrayContains('genres', 'progressive-rock')
  .find();
```

All the \*Where methods have a similar api, where the first parameter is a string that represents the field that we want to search for and the second one is the value that we want to compare to (which can be any [JavaScript primitive type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Primitive_values)). FireORM-Web also provide an alternative API to make it more type safe; the first parameter can also accept a lamda function where it's first parameter is the type of the model of the repository.

```ts
// This example is exactly the same than the last one, but using the alternative API.

// Bands formed from 1990 onwards
await bandRepository
  .whereGreaterOrEqualThan((band) => band.formationYear, 1990)
  .find();

// Bands whose name is Porcupine Tree
await bandRepository
  .whereEqualTo((band) => band.name, 'Porcupine Tree')
  .find();

// Bands formed after 1985 and that play Progressive Rock
await bandRepository
  .whereGreaterThan((band) => band.formationYear, 1985)
  .whereArrayContains((band) => band.genres, 'progressive-rock')
  .find();
```

### Complex Queries with Realtime Update

Similar to `findByIdAndListen`, you can get data and listen for changes in real time. To do this, use the `findAndListen` method.

```ts
function renderBandList(bands) {
  // ... some render logic
}

// run querie and start listin
const unsubscribe = bandRepository.findAndListen(renderBandList, console.error);

// stop listen
unsubscribe();
```

### Pipe for Post Processing

Sometimes it is convenient to automatically process the received data. You can use the `pipe` method for this, passing any number of callbacks to it as arguments. This way you can transfer the filter, map and other data processing to the client side.

```ts
await bandRepository
  .pipe(
    (bands) => bands.filter((band) => band.formationYear > 1985 && band.formationYear < 1990),
    (bands) => bands.map((band) => band.name.toLowerCase()),
  )
  .find();
```

### Search by Document Reference

We can use the document reference as the value in any of the helpers function described above.

```ts
// Fake DocumentReference
class FirestoreDocumentReference {
  _id: string;
  path: string;
}

@Collection()
class BandWithReference {
  _id: string;
  name: string;
  formationYear: number;
  genres: string[];

  @Type(() => FirestoreDocumentReference)
  relatedBand?: FirestoreDocumentReference;
}

const pt = new Band();

pt._id = 'porcupine-tree';
pt.name = 'Porcupine Tree';
pt.formationYear = 1987;
pt.genres = ['psychedelic-rock', 'progressive-rock', 'progressive-metal'];

await bandRepository.create(pt);

// Filter documents by a doc reference
const band = await bandRepository.whereEqualTo((item) => item.relatedBand, ptRef).find();

// Can also use the string api of the complex query
const band = await bandRepository.whereEqualTo('relatedBand', ptRef).find();
```

### Order By and Limit

FireORM-Web repositories also provide functions to order documents and limit the quantity of documents that we will retrieve. These are `orderByAscending`, `orderByDescending`, `limit` and `offset`. Please be aware that you can only use one orderBy, one offset and one limit per query.

```ts
// Bands formed from 1990 onwards or
await bandRepository
  .whereGreaterOrEqualThan((band) => band.formationYear, 1990)
  .orderByAscending('name')
  .find();

// Top 10 bands whose formationYear is 1987 in ascending order by formationYear (using the alternative api)
await bandRepository
  .whereEqualTo((band) => band.formationYear, 1987)
  .orderByAscending((band) => band.formationYear)
  .limit(10)
  .find();

// Top 3 bands formed after 1985 and that play Progressive Rock, skip first
await bandRepository
  .whereGreaterThan((band) => band.formationYear, 1985)
  .whereArrayContains((band) => band.genres, 'progressive-rock')
  .offset(1)
  .limit(3)
  .find();
```

### Limitations on Complex queries

Please be aware that fireorm-web cannot circumvent [Firestore query limitations](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/query-data/queries#query_limitations), we still have to create indexes if we want to create queries that involve more than one field.

## Manage Data

Now that we know how to retrieve documents from Firestore, it's time to finish the rest of our CRUD operations.

### Create Documents

FireORM-Web repositories provide a `create` method to save new documents into Firestore. If at the moment of calling the `create` method you don't provide an `_id`, an autogenerated id will be used.

```ts
import { Collection, getRepository } from 'fireorm-web';
import Band from './wherever-our-models-are';

const bandRepository = getRepository(Band);
const rush = new Band();

rush.name = 'Rush';
rush.formationYear = 1968;
rush.genres = ['progressive-rock', 'hard-rock', 'heavy-metal'];

await bandRepository.create(rush);
```

### Update Documents

Not all information we store in Firestore will remain unedited forever, so we need a way to edit the data we already have. No worries, FireORM-Web repositories provide an `update` method to update the data we already have stored in our documents.

```ts
import { Collection, getRepository } from 'fireorm-web';
import Band from './wherever-our-models-are';

const bandRepository = getRepository(Band);
const rush = await bandRepository.findById('rush');

rush.name = 'rush';

await bandRepository.update(rush);
```

You can also specify a strategy for updating documents by passing options as the second argument.

```ts
await bandRepository.update(rush, {merge: true});
```

### Delete Documents

By now you know the drill. FireORM-Web repositories provide an `delete` method to delete documents.

```ts
import { Collection, getRepository } from 'fireorm-web';
import Band from './wherever-our-models-are';

const bandRepository = getRepository(Band);
const rush = await bandRepository.findById('rush');

await bandRepository.delete(rush);
```
